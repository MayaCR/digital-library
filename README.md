-   Javascript

## Challenges

-   Error validation based on user interaction

## What I Learned\Practiced

-   DOM manipulation using Javascript

-   Value of `this` keyword and scope

## Takeaway

-   This project was not as difficult to complete on the programming sides as some of the others, but it provided emphasis on why a well executed user experience design is important. Also learned the importance of error validation and providing the user with clear visual queues in relation to a completed action and the result.
